       <h3>The Power of Wisdom </h3>  
       <p> Wisdom is not just about what you know, but how you live what you know. It guides your actions, shapes your words, and helps you see beyond appearances. A wise person understands that real growth begins in the heart before it reaches the mind.</p>  
        <blockquote>  
        Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom.<cite>— Proverbs 4:7</cite>  
      </blockquote>

     <p> Discipline is the path that leads from intention to achievement. It teaches patience, builds focus, and turns dreams into habits. Through discipline, you gain control over your actions and learn that freedom comes through self-mastery, not comfort.</p>  
     <blockquote>  
     No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness.<cite> — Hebrews 12:11 </cite>

      <h3> Understanding Life’s Seasons </h3>  
     <p> Life flows in cycles — seasons of growth, silence, joy, and waiting. When you learn to embrace each moment for what it is, you find peace even in uncertainty. Every season holds a purpose; the key is to be still enough to learn from it.</p>  
     <blockquote>To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. <cite> — Ecclesiastes 3:1 </cite>
