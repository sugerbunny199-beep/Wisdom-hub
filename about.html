    <h2>About Us</h2>  
    <p>  
      The Wisdom & Knowledge Hub is a space built to inspire growth, reflection, and understanding.  
      We explore timeless truths drawn from spirituality, discipline, and experience — guiding people toward a meaningful life.  
    </p>  <p>  
  Our goal is to help you find balance between the physical and the spiritual,  
  reminding you of the wisdom found in ancient teachings such as those from the book of Ecclesiastes.  
</p>  

<p>  
  We believe that knowledge without wisdom is incomplete — that true understanding comes from reflection, discipline, and purpose.
